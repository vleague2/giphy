# GIF Searcher Project

This website allows users to search for gifs pulled from the Giphy API. It's a project built as part of UCF's coding bootcamp program.

How to use the website:
1. Click on any of the buttons to search for gifs!
2. Or add your own search term.
3. Click on the gifs to play them, and click again to pause.

How it works:
1. Based on a pre-determined list of dessert-themed words, the site generates a series of buttons that the user can use to search for gifs related to those words.
2. The user has the ability to enter a new search term and add it to the button list.
3. When a button is clicked, the site pulls gifs from the Giphy API and displays them for the user, along with content ratings.
4. The gifs appear as static images, but when clicked they animate. If clicked again, they are reset to static.

Technologies used:
1. HTML with Bootstrap
2. CSS
3. Javascript with JQuery

Limitations:
1. Sidebar background color overtakes whole page when viewed on mobile
